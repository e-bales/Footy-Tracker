# Footy-Tracker

A dynamic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript solo project, built upon my passion for all things football (soccer)!
View the current league tables for all the top five European leagues (Premier League, Serie A, Bundesliga, La Liga, and Ligue 1).
Additionally, click on a team to view a myriad of statistics about their performance from this season, and view the players in each squad.
Interested in who is giving it their all? Click on the 'League Leaders' in the nav-bar to view top the scorers and playmakers!
