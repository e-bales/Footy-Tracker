# Footy-Tracker

A fun HTML, CSS, and JavaScript solo project for users who want to keep up with the league tables of Europe's Top 5 Leagues.

This project was to test if I could craft HTML and manipulate the DOM to emulate the league tables of different soccer (football) leagues across Europe. 
Using a RESTful API to gather the league data, I created a table for each league, as well as pages for allowing the user to view statistics for individual teams, and who the top goal scorers and playmakers are. 
Feel free to click around and explore the project!
