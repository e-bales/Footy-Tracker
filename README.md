# ‚öΩFooty-Tracker

A fun HTML, CSS, and JavaScript solo project for users who want to keep up with the league tables of Europe's Top 5 Leagues.

This project was to test if I could craft HTML and manipulate the DOM to emulate the league tables of different soccer (football) leagues across Europe. 
Using a RESTful API to gather the league data, I created a table for each league, as well as pages for allowing the user to view statistics for individual teams, and who the top goal scorers and playmakers are. 
Feel free to click around and explore the project!

# üëçFeatures

Users can view each of the Top 5 Leagues in Europe: English Premier League, Spanish La Liga, German Bundesliga, Italian Serie A, French Ligue 1. The scores update when you first view a table, and then every twenty-four hours after. Clicking on a team brings up information about that team, such as most used formations, total wins/losses/draws, and their manager. Additionally, users may view who the current players are, and can scroll through the squad which has been split by positions: Goalkeepers, Defenders, Midfielders, and Attackers. Lastly, users may also view who the top Goalscorers and Playmakers are for each League by clickign the option in the top right of the navbar.
